# Instructions to Run Project
1. Install Node.js (https://nodejs.org/en/download). You can check and see if you already have Node.js using the terminal command `node -v `.
2. `git clone https://github.com/ankithkanderi24/4261project1.git` into designated folder.
3. `cd` into cloned project directory.
4. Download dependencies using `yarn expo add` or `npm install expo`.
5. Then, you can run `npx expo start`. If you encounter an `EACCES` when you run the `npx expo start` command, make sure that you are running the project as an administrator. On MacOS terminals, this can be fixed with the command `sudo npx expo start`. On Windows terminals, you can simply run the terminal as an administrator.
6. At this point, your terminal should display a QR code.
7. Download the Expo Go app on Android or IOS. On Android, use the Expo Go app to scan the QR code from your terminal to open your project. On iOS, use the built-in QR code scanner of the default iOS Camera app.
8. Your app should now display in the Expo Go App!
